# Deep Learning From Scratch with PyTorch
Purpose: to break down deep learning concepts and architecture into code using PyTorch! It's easy import from libraries and never really understand what something is doing. This repo is to reimplement common architectures and atomic concepts in deep learning in simpler code. 

- Dropout
- LSTM
- MADE
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Self Attention
- Transformer
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
